# SER515: Autonomous Rover Development Environment


This repository is a python module to make ROS2 easier to implement using a Object Oriented paradigm.

### Run
`python3 -m ezRos`

<br />

### What we currently Offer
<br />

- Launch a testing ground for the testing the developed rover, also offers modularity in terms of wheel alignment and sensor mounting.

- Controller to manually override the rover movement which closely mimics ROS2's teleop twist keyboard.

- Environment Setup lets user install all the required packages and libraries for development workspace in a hassle free manner.

- Test Installations lets the user run test scripts to verify the integrity of the packages and libraries installed.

- Launch ROS2, fires ROS2 with the user specified nodes and sets up the network. As a placeholder we currently put a couple of turtlesim nodes

- Generating maze.
