### Instructions to move rover around

Assuming that `ros2`, `gazebo` and `python` are already installed on the workspace, the script will be executed using the following command:

Step 1: In the terminal use `python3 move_rover.py` and give `'1'` as input to start gazebo with the rover.

Step 2: In the terminal use `python3 move_rover.py` and give 2-6 commands to engage movement in the rover.

There is a `/Rover Environment` directory in the workspace. Make sure to insert `testing-ground` on `gazebo` before running the script. This ensures that the rover never goes out of the virtual environment, as this may lead to unexpected behaviour.
